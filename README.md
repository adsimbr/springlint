# Smelly Cat (Spring MVC version)

Smelly Cat is a simple tool that detects smells that are specific 
to Spring MVC applications.

This tool is based on our paper (which will be published soon).

# How to Contribute with a Smell

Create an issue describing your Spring MVC smell. After that, you
are free to implement it! Don't forget the tests!
